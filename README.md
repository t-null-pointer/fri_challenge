## Acknowledgements
Boilerplate reference: https://github.com/jpolley/WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript/

## Issues noticed
1. the progress bar is set to a wrong stage on page reload
2. when a valid date from the first registration ("Erstzulassung") is deleted again the value is not re-set correctly (value="__._") so the placeholder text is not shown (same for all "date" fields)

Usability
1. it would be nice if the back link ("Zur√ºck") was also available at the top of the form to avoid long scrolling on e.g. /selectVehicle

## Current limitations
1. I didn't use webdriverIO before so please do not expect best practices here :)
2. only covers some test cases in the sales funnel up until the step /enterBirthDate, focus is on car selection
3. cross-browser support needs to be added, currently only runs in chrome and firefox (but set to chrome for now)
4. different viewports need to be added
5. negative inputs + error messages are not tested yet
6. navigation (browser back, going back via link, page reload) is not tested yet
6. header and footer are not tested yet
